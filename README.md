Features
QR Code Integration
Wiggles uses QR codes to help pet parents connect with each other and share essential information about their furry friends.

Lost Pet Assistance
In the unfortunate event that a pet goes missing, Wiggles provides a "Lost Mode" feature, converting the QR code into a digital tag with crucial information for a quick reunion.

Social Connectivity
Share your pet's QR code on various social media platforms to connect with other pet parents and their adorable companions.

Vaccination Records
Wiggles includes a dedicated section for storing and managing vaccination details for your pets. Easily generate a PDF of your pet's vaccination records or use a link for sharing or safekeeping.

Git Messaging Convention
This is the convention to be followed for commit messages. This will help maintain readability, traceability, and collaboration throughout the development process.

Commit Message Structure
A commit message consists of three distinct parts separated by a blank line: the header, the body, and the footer. Each part should be concise and informative.

<type>(<optional scope>): <description>
empty separator line

<optional footer>
Header

Types
The type describes the kind of change that this commit is providing.

style: A CSS or formatting change

test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing ones
chore: Changes that do not affect the external user (e.g. updating the .gitignore file or .prettierrc file).

Scope
The scope provides context for the commit, indicating the component or area of the codebase affected by the change. Eg. all, component name, api, etc.

Description
A succinct description of the change, written in the imperative mood. Don't capitalize the first letter, no dot (.) at the end.
